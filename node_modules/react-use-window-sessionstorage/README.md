üëÅÔ∏è **[Live Demo](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageString#example)**

_For localStorage, see [react-use-window-localstorage](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-localstorage)._

## Overview

A set of hooks to easily store and retrieve data from [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).

Encoding is handled for common data types, including [booleans](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageBoolean), [numbers](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageNumber), [strings](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageString), and [objects](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageObject), or you can [encode data yourself](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageItem) if you'd like.

Changes to sessionStorage are synchronized across all hooks automatically.

> **What is sessionStorage?** The `sessionStorage` property allows you to store `{key: value}` string data that is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the browser is open, and survives over page reloads and restores.

> For localStorage, check out the companion project [react-use-window-localstorage](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-localstorage).

### Features include:

- **üí™ Easily add `sessionStorage` support**
  - Easily store data that is cleared when the page session ends.
- **üî¢ Support for primitives and objects**
  - Store and retrieve strings, booleans, numbers, and objects effortlessly.
- **üíÅ Default values**
  - Optional support for defaults is baked right in.
- **üîÑ Automatic synchronization**
  - Changes are synchronized across hooks automatically.
- **üëæ Customizable**
  - Want to store something unusual? Just provide your own encoder.
- **‚õî Storage availability detection**
  - Detects if `sessionStorage` is available for use and lets you know otherwise.
- **üßº Clearing support**
  - Clear all sessionStorage values and reset hooks to defaults with one simple call.

## Installation

```
npm i react-use-window-sessionstorage
```

## Quick Start

### Storing Strings

Use the [useSessionStorageString](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageString) hook:

```jsx
import { useSessionStorageString } from "react-use-window-sessionstorage";
```

In your function component:

```jsx
const defaultValue = "cyan";
const [value, setValue] = useSessionStorageString("favColor", defaultValue);
```

### Storing Objects

Use the [useSessionStorageObject](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageObject) hook:

```jsx
import { useSessionStorageObject } from "react-use-window-sessionstorage";
```

In your function component:

```jsx
const defaultValue = { a: "hello", b: 123 };
const [value, setValue] = useSessionStorageObject("myObj", defaultValue);
```

Note that your objects must be compatible with [JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify). Use [useSessionStorageItem](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageItem) otherwise.

### Storing Booleans

Use the [useSessionStorageBoolean](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageBoolean) hook:

```jsx
import { useSessionStorageBoolean } from "react-use-window-sessionstorage";
```

In your function component:

```jsx
const defaultValue = true;
const [value, setValue] = useSessionStorageBoolean(
  "swordEquipped",
  defaultValue
);
```

### Storing Numbers

Use the [useSessionStorageNumber](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageNumber) hook:

```jsx
import { useSessionStorageNumber } from "react-use-window-sessionstorage";
```

In your function component:

```jsx
const defaultValue = 3.14159;
const [value, setValue] = useSessionStorageNumber(
  "importantNumber",
  defaultValue
);
```

> Note: All value defaults are optional. Hooks will return `null` if none is provided.

### Storing Everything Else

If you'd like to store something other than the data types above, define your own encoding using the [useSessionStorageItem](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-window-sessionstorage/useSessionStorageItem) hook.

Here's a starting point:

```jsx
import { useSessionStorageItem } from "react-use-window-sessionstorage";
```

In your function component:

```jsx
const defaultValue = "something custom";
const encode = (value) => JSON.stringify(value);
const decode = (itemString) => JSON.parse(itemString);
const [value, setValue] = useSessionStorageItem(
  "name",
  defaultValue,
  encode,
  decode
);
```

Provide `null` for no default value.

### Additional Features

All hooks provide additional features in their return arrays, should you be interested:

```jsx
const [value, setValue, loading, available, reset] = useSessionStorageString(
  "favColor",
  "cyan"
);
```

- A `loading` value of `true` indicates that the value is being loaded from sessionStorage.
- An `available` value of `true` indicates that `sessionStorage` is supported and available for use.
- The `reset()` function sets the value back to the provided default, or `null` if none was given.

### Clearing `sessionStorage`

```jsx
import { useClearSessionStorage } from "react-use-window-sessionstorage";
```

```jsx
const clearSessionStorage = useClearSessionStorage();
```

Call `clearSessionStorage()` to clear all values in sessionStorage using [sessionStorage.clear()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
and reset all hooks to their defaults (or `null` if none provided).
